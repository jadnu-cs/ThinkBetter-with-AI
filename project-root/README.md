Project Title: ThinkBetterAI

This website showcases the proper usage of AI in terms of ethical use and GenAI FAQs. It also provides a guideline on how to effectively use AI. It also explains the AI analogy given, by relating it into "vibe code".

Instructions:

As soon as you open the page scroll down to navigate the navigation bar. The navbar has 4 buttons and it only pops up when scrolled at the bottom (using global js). The website contains 4 webpages; homepage, FAQs, Ethical use and the Analogy AI page. Using the navbar you can switch to these different pages. 

Frameworks:
HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap

This website is deployed using Github and Netlify.

The CSS is contained inside each of the HTML file. (I was planning on creating a global.css but I find it hard to track the elements used.)

The javascript file is contained in the assets folder.

Some of the content are just paraphrased/copy pasted from the references given. (FAQs and Ethical Use)
